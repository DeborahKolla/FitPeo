# FitPeo
Objective This repository contains the automation scripts for the FitPeo Revenue Calculator testing assignment. The primary goal is to assess web navigation and interaction capabilities using Selenium WebDriver (or your chosen automation tool) with a focus on best coding practices and script maintainability.
Test Cases Covered
The automation script performs the following actions:

Navigate to the FitPeo Homepage and access the Revenue Calculator Page.
Scroll to the slider section and adjust its value to 820, ensuring the corresponding text field updates dynamically.
Update the text field with a value of 560 and validate that the slider reflects the updated value.
Select CPT codes (CPT-99091, CPT-99453, CPT-99454, CPT-99474) and verify checkbox functionality.
Validate that the header displaying the Total Recurring Reimbursement value updates correctly to $110700.
Features
Comprehensive validation of dynamic web elements (sliders, text fields, and checkboxes).
Robust exception handling for smoother script execution.
Fully documented code for ease of understanding and maintenance.
